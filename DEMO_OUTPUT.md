## Key Features Demonstrated

### ✅ Recursive File Reading
- Uses `fs.readdirSync()` to read directory contents
- Implements recursive exploration of subdirectories
- Handles nested directory structures efficiently

### ✅ fs.statSync Usage
- Uses `fs.statSync()` to get detailed file information
- Retrieves file sizes, types, and other metadata
- Properly handles file system errors

### ✅ Terminal Formatting (chalk)
- **Blue Bold**: Directory names
- **Green**: "(Directory)" labels
- **Cyan Bold**: File names
- **Yellow**: File sizes
- **Red**: Error messages
- **Magenta**: User prompts

### ✅ Interactive Features
- Prompts user for subdirectory exploration
- Provides choice between shallow and deep exploration
- Clean, organized output with clear sections

### ✅ Advanced Features
- Human-readable file sizes (B, KB, MB, GB, TB)
- Smart sorting (directories first, then files)
- Comprehensive statistics summary
- Error handling and validation
- Cross-platform compatibility

## Technical Implementation

### Performance Optimizations
- Efficient file system operations
- Proper error handling for permissions and missing files
- Memory-efficient processing
- Resource cleanup with proper promise handling

### Code Quality
- Clean, modular function structure
- Comprehensive error handling
- User-friendly interface design
- Professional documentation
